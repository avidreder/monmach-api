# Monster Machine API

This is the API for [Monster Machine](https://github.com/avidreder/monmach-client), a tool that leverages the Spotify API to help people find new music. It is written in [Go](https://golang.org/), using the [Echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo) web framework. It uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for data storage, and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) for deployment.
